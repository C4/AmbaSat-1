# AmbaSat-1
 
AmbaSat-1 is tiny spacecraft kit that you assemble and code yourself.

Once your satellite kit is assembled and programmed, it will be launched onboard a commercial rocket which will deploy your satellite into Low Earth Orbit, where it will spend up to 3 months in space.

AmbaSat-1 is part of a new generation of satellites known as Sprite satellites. They are tiny spacecraft measuring 35 mm square and just a few millimetres thick. Pioneered by the original KickSat, groups of AmbaSat-1 satellites are launched onboard a commercial rocket. By shrinking the spacecraft, up to 200 satellites can be launched at a time, reducing costs.

Making use of The Things Network (TTN), AmbaSats are capable of transmitting data to over seven thousand earthbased TTN receivers (Gateways) which are spread around the whole globe. No specialist radio receiving equipment is required, your data appears over the internet directly to your AmbaSat Dashboard.

AmbaSats are just a little bigger than the size of a couple of postage stamps but have solar cells, a LoRaWAN radio transceiver, microcontroller (an Arduino compatible ATMEGA 328P-AU), memory, a gyroscope, accelerometer, magnetometer as well as a range of other sensor options.
